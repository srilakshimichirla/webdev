            <h2 style="color: paleturquoise;">INTRODUCTION:</h2>
            <p>
                In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall that if p(x)
                is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of the polynomial.<br/>For example:<br/>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 1.</li>
                <li>2y<sup>3</sup> - 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 3.</li>
                <li>5x<sup>4</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup> + x - 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of degree 4.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Expressions like 1 / (x - 1), x + 2, and 1 / (x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 3) are not polynomials.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: palevioletred;">Linear Polynomial</h2>
            <p>
                A polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>2x - 3</li>
                <li>3x + 2</li>
                <li>x - 3/11</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Polynomials such as 2x + 5 - x<sup>2</sup>, x + 1 etc., are not linear polynomials.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: palevioletred;">Quadratic Polynomial</h2>
            <p>
                A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name 'quadratic' has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means 'square'.
            </p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 2/5</li>
                <li>y<sup>2</sup> - 2</li>
                <li>2 - x<sup>2</sup> + 3x</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                More generally, any quadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax² + bx + cwhere a, b, c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: palevioletred;">Cubic Polynomial</h2>
            <p>
                A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial.
